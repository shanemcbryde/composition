# What’s Hidden Within the Pay Gap?  
## *Rhetoric, Reality, and Reform*

### The Power of a Statistic  
When we compare the overall earnings of men and women, the disparity is clear. The question, however, is not whether a gap exists; it's what's hidden within. When overall gendered incomes are compared, it is found that women earn 77 percent of what men earn (Misra and Strader). Feminist policy institutions, those that lead advocacy efforts, publish gender-focused research, and lobby for workplace reforms, often cite the 77 percent earnings statistic as evidence that women are being harmed by and require protection from systemic gender discrimination. Over the years, numerous articles have used the existence of the pay gap, almost without exception, to support the claim that women are paid less than men for the same work, due to discrimination. The outward appearance of this single statistic does not, however, tell the full story. While feminist policy institutions frequently present it as proof of widespread bias, discrimination is just one of many factors contributing to the gender pay gap, and arguably not the most significant.

Immersion in feminist doctrine can easily lead to the impression that the pay gap is directly and almost exclusively due to workplace discrimination. One telling article by Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a leading think tank focused on domestic women’s issues, initially acknowledges that women’s real earnings continued to grow over a 25-year period during which men’s earnings stagnated. Hartmann offers economic explanations for this trend, but then concludes: “Now it seems as if the (economic) current is finally overpowering women, making it increasingly difficult for them to swim upstream. This is not to say that discrimination is any worse than it has been in the past, but progress in reducing discrimination is no longer being made.” The article shifts focus, first attributing stalled earnings to economic forces, then unexpectedly invoking discrimination. Yet this framing is difficult to reconcile with the fact that men’s earnings had already declined under the same conditions decades earlier.

Yet another typical use of the pay gap is its treatment in a report by the National Women’s Law Center, a 40-year-old women’s legal advocacy organization. The report makes the claim that “women working full time, year-round were typically paid just 77 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts, a loss of $11,084” (50 Years). Framing the pay gap as a loss suggests that the difference is something unjustly withheld, implying discrimination. This framing is echoed in political messaging as well. President Obama, after citing the 77 percent figure in a State of the Union address, immediately followed with the statement, “A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.” Pairing these two claims together creates the impression that women are routinely paid less than men for performing the same job. The evidence, however, paints a distinctly different picture.

### Reframing the Numbers  
While the 77 cents on the dollar figure is frequently cited when discussing the pay gap, more equitable figures exist. When comparing weekly wages instead of annual wages, the pay gap reduces to 81 cents (Brugger). Taking the next logical step and accounting for the fact that men, on average, work more hours per day, a comparison of hourly wages reduces the gap to only 86 cents (Brugger). This is a simple and more honest shift from the 77-cent narrative.

Even more telling is the fact that women of the Millennial generation, being more educated, participating in greater numbers, and having an increased presence in higher-paying occupations, are closing the pay gap at an unprecedented pace (“Young Women” 19). According to HR Magazine, the largest circulating human resources publication in the world, “In 2012, women ages 25 to 34 earned 93 percent of what their male counterparts made, up from 89 percent in 2005” (“Young Women” 19).

Another segment of women who buck the 77-cent statistic, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics report, *Highlights of Women's Earnings in 2012*, are women who have never married or had children. This segment of women earns 96 percent of what their unmarried male counterparts earn (Perry and Biggs). The much-publicized book *Creating a Life*, which has been featured on the cover of *Time Magazine*, reflects this fact in its premise that the more successful a woman is, the less likely she is to have married or had children (Belkin).

### The Role of Family and Lifestyle  
Beyond hours worked, the realities of family life and household responsibilities play a significant role in shaping earnings. As such, while discrimination may play a role, spousal support, household care, and child-rearing are far more significant contributors to the pay gap. Research on time spent on household tasks and child rearing shows that it negatively affects the wages of both women and men (Misra and Strader). Since women tend to engage in these tasks more than men, this has a disproportionate impact on their earnings. As well, married men with stay-at-home spouses have more time to contribute financially, and even earn a noticeable wage bonus. That bonus, however, declines with each additional hour their spouse spends in paid work (Misra and Strader).

### Occupational Segregation and Household Decisions  
The decision over who stays home to manage the household and care for the children is a private matter between spouses. One factor in that decision, however, is the fact that male-dominated occupations tend to pay more than female-dominated occupations (Hegewisch and Matite). The odds that the husband holds the higher-paying job are strong, given that only six percent of women work in traditionally male occupations and fewer than five percent of men work in traditionally female occupations (Hegewisch and Matite). Given the slow pace of occupational change, this pattern is unlikely to shift significantly in the near future.

### Career Preferences and Cultural Context  
Efforts to close the pay gap by encouraging women to enter male-dominated professions have met resistance, as most women continue to choose careers that align with their own interests rather than external expectations. After compiling the results of a 250-question survey of 15-year-olds from 35 countries in different parts of the world, researchers from the University of Oslo, Norway, found that girls from wealthier, more egalitarian societies are significantly less likely to express interest in male-dominated fields than either boys overall or girls from less developed countries. In parallel, girls from countries with the lowest poverty rates show a stronger preference for traditionally female occupations (Sjøberg and Schreiner).

### Values, Autonomy, and Reform  
Women are speaking through their actions, regardless of the social agendas others may project onto them, and making life choices on their own terms. Most are opting for traditionally female careers, prioritizing family over career advancement, and crafting a lifestyle that values flexibility and fulfillment over earnings alone. As the *New York Times Magazine* article *The Opt-Out Revolution* relates, “(instead of using) the male definition of money and power...when women talk about success they use words like satisfaction, balance and sanity” (Belkin 45). This appears to be a more considered and holistic approach to personal success.

Still, none of this is to suggest that nothing can be done to help women achieve greater economic parity with men. Policies such as maternity leave, family leave, subsidized childcare, universal health care, raising the minimum wage, and flextime could all contribute meaningfully to narrowing the pay gap. By focusing on what women actually value, and directing reform efforts toward those goals, rather than being sidetracked by unfounded claims, we can better serve everyone: women, men, and the families they build together. **Reform grounded in reality, not rhetoric, is the surest path to change that works—and endures.**
